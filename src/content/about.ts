const aboutDescription = `Growing up, I had one dream: becoming a football player. Life had other plans.
      <br>
      As a teenager, I gravitated toward technology - chose Computer Science first, actually.
      Plot twist: I thought I hated programming. Switched to Biomedical Engineering, and that's
      where everything clicked. It wasn't about the code itself; it was the logic, the problem-solving,
      the ability to bring ideas to life. Turns out, I didn't hate programming - I just hadn't found the
      right way into it yet.
      <br>
      Now? I'm a software developer who genuinely loves this work. Python became my language of choice
      after an optional university class showed me how simple getting things done could be. These days,
      I build backend systems (where I'm most comfortable) and dabble in frontend with Vue.js when needed.
      <br>
      <br>
      Outside of code, you'll find me with a camera in hand - I shoot with a Sony mirrorless and fly a
      drone when I can. I've been a gamer since the Gameboy Pocket days, and I'm always planning the
      next trip to discover new cultures and cuisines. There's something about meeting locals and
      experiencing a place through its food that never gets old.
      <br>
      <br>
      Health tech is where my heart is. That Biomedical Engineering degree wasn't wasted after all - it
      just led me to impact healthcare differently than I expected.
      <br>
      Fair warning: I'm terrible at naming repositories. But hey, at least my GitHub contribution graph
      stays consistently green.`;
